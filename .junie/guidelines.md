# Project Guidelines


* Build the project before submitting the result
* It is critically important that the data access format is not changed or the JSON style is not changed so people do not experience breaking changes
* Datastores should have a version number
* After a successful build, do a git commit with a meaningful comment. Ensure the repo is in a clean state at the end.
